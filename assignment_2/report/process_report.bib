abstract = {The ICDM Challenge 2013 is to apply machine learning to the problem of hotel ranking, aiming to maximize purchases according to given hotel characteristics, location at- tractiveness of hotels, users aggregated purchase history and competitive online travel agency (OTA) information for each potential hotel choice. This paper describes the solution of team ”binghsu \& MLRush \& BrickMover”.We conduct simple feature engineering work and train different models by each individual team member. Afterwards, we use listwise ensemble method to combine each model’s output. Besides describing effective model and features, we will discuss about the lessons we learned while using deep learning in this competition. I.},
