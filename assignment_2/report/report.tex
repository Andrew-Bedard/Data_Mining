\section{Introduction}
The online travel agency (OTA) Expedia posed the challenge to rank hotels by their likelihood of being booked. In such a competitive market as the one of click-through purchases, properly ranking offered hotels according to user's preferences becomes indispensable if the OTA wishes to win the sale. See the Kaggle platform \cite{WinNT} for further information on the competition.

This report details our approach to tackling this problem based on the search and click-through data provided by Expedia. First, a description of the data is provided and the problem is defined in more rigorous terms, after which a short review of the available literature on the topic is given. Then follows a review of the methods and models used by us and how they held up to the challenge. Finally, we finish off with a summary and some concluding remarks.
